Main goal:

Get the bags in the barrow before timer reaches 0

Hazards:

- The guards kill you on contact
- A fall from a height greater than your height kills you
- Elevators kill you if they fall onto you
- The mine carts will kill you unless you can grab handles. In that case, you can even drop down to the cart
- When you're in the cart, you are invincible, unless an elevator falls on you :)
- When you're carrying bags, you move slower. When carrying the blue bag, you move even slower

Assets:

- use the mine carts to safely & quickly carry bags
- elevators help you to cross screens with the barrow and to reach some otherwise unreachable areas
- you need the pickaxe to destroy the wall that protects the blue bag,
- you can use the pickaxe to frighten/kill the guards (does not work when you're on a ladder)
- blocking a guard's path on the ladder when on top of it with the pick or the barrow causes the guard to fall down

General tactics:

- When the guards are not in your screen, they are guided to your screen automatically.
- When the guards are not in your screen, they also never wait for elevators
  You can use that to divert them from elevators by switching screens when you're waiting for a free elevator
- clear screen 1 & all bags from screen 2 except the rightmost ones
  get the blue & yellow bags of bottom screen 2 using the cart before guards come too close and bring them back to screen 1
  when the guards are patrolling at the bottom of screen 1/2, get the bags from the dead end gallery in screen 2 & the other one,
  still with the barrow on screen 1
- when clear, move to screen 3 and clear remaining screen 2 bags and screen 3 bags from here
- Don't try to play with barrow on screen 2: the guards are too much at advantage on this screen, the elevator is not safe.
  Get all screen 2 bags when barrow is either on screen 1 or on screen 3 as stated above.
- In screen 3, if you can keep the guards in the elevator or make them go out, you control the situation.
- The higher score you get, the fastest the guards run. On the ladders, they always have the same speed.
- The elevators moves are not independent. They only move when you're on the same screen. They also share direction. If you change
  to screen 2 and make the elevator go down, when going back to screen 3, the elevator will also go down (and you'll lose a life :))
- When carrying pickaxe for a long distance, drop it from time to time to avoid timeout
- When dropping the last bag (on screen 3), the barrow will remain there for the next level,
  which makes the start of the next level difficult. Getting the barrow on screen 2 or even 1
  when there's only one bag left can be a nice option (leave 1 bag at screen 1/2)
