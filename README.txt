Bagman remake by JOTD in 2010-2023

Original game by Valadon Automation
ROM strings show that it has been coded by Jacques Brisse (still head of Valadon in 2015 at least)

Game has been resourced (Z80) and A.I & speeds extracted from the first versions. Now the Amiga version
uses 100% of the transcoded original code for better accuracy.

History: 

2010: first SDL version (Windows)
2015: fixed a lot of bugs on SDL version
2019: Amiga version (needs 68020+ and fastmem)
2023: Amiga version using real game code transcoded to 68000 (should run on A500)
