Bagman remake by JOTD in 2019 - Amiga OS 68k quick & dirty port

history:

- Done in 1 afternoon from the NDS/Windows SDL version
- Redone in, well, more than 1 afternoon using native amiga graphic & sound capabilities
- Redone in ... a few weeks to use only asm & sprites using original game code

now works properly on low-end amigas like A500.
