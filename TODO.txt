- walk blocks, guards frozen (same bug probably)
- add 10 to score (walk) OK but resets to 0 at 90 (debug add_to_score_5C90)
- wagon moves completely off
- picks drawn twice, blinking
- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)
- maybe try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background

- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow
  - 2 for others
  

- sprite/tiles conflict.

  * maybe make tile palette fit in 16 colors (forgetting BAGMAN title
  and green, purple on screen which can be faked using coppper, which forces to reactivate
  dynamic copper for sprites too unless we restore original colors when displaying title)

  * setting green & purple & title cols after 16 would also work
