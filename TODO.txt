minor gfx errors (can't be fixed easily):

- sprite colormap allocation issue: sometimes player/carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed 
  when 3 wagons appear at screen 2). This is rare, would be fixed by AGA chipset but
  really it's not worth the time!

probable original game bugs, won't be fixed:

- in demo, guard appears at screen 2, falls and immediately disappears: this is also
  happening in real arcade game demo! So original game bug, fortunately not occurring
  while playing!
