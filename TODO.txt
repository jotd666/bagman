- first A500 boot: locks up: investigate (ok when resetting!!)
- remaster music: in progress

- start 2P game??
- joystick/fire to start game/insert coin not working

- intermission: music doesn't play / sfx are playing in demo when guard is chasing player
- invincible flag in demo game should be made inefficient: doesn't work: game_locked_6053 during demo???

- sometimes carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed with wagons)
