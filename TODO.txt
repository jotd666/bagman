- first A500 boot: locks up: investigate (ok when resetting!!)
- remaster music: in progress
- start 2P game: issue with "PLAYER x" screen tiles error


- intermission: music doesn't play / sfx are playing in demo when guard is chasing player
- invincible flag in demo game should be made inefficient: doesn't work: game_locked_6053 during demo???
- hard bag layout appeared once in 2P mode!

- sometimes (very rare) carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed with wagons)
