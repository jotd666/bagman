- "PLAYER 1" flashes with wrong timing
- set supervisor state at start in DOS mode (revert to user in the end)
- press 5 to insert coin works 1 time out of 2 (previous state interfering?)
- sometimes carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed with wagons)
  => screen 2: elevator clut forced at white+orange,
     generate 2 copies of elevator and change CLUT in screen 2 so it still matches player clut
	 but uses third color (red)
- check level complete in non whdload (SR not reset so....)
- brown/blue stripe on row 0? disable those rows completely
- timer at 400: stop sound
- killed: stop sound
- sfx are playing in demo when guard is chasing player

- restore music
- start 2P game??
- joystick/fire to start game/insert coin not working
- invincible flag in demo game should be made inefficient
- add option to start at hard level directly: done plug it
- make command line options work: done, to test
- TODO where is D6 defined ? debug this      	| [$0a17: ld   a,l]

- the original game had a tendency (not all the time) to leave the barrow in the last screen when you completed
  the level, which is unfair and makes next level very difficult because you have to bring back the barrow or go
  to last screen right after appearing in the first screen.
- enhance instructions


- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)


maybe...:
- try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow, falling bag, pick, elevator
  - 2 for guards
  - 3 for wagons
