- press 5 to insert coin works 1 time out of 2
- walking on slopes Y seems +1
- guard seems hesitant to change direction
- guard at level 3 probably doesn't follow guide (debug with MAME & addresses)
- pickup barrow: turns to pick..., dropping is buggy
- pickup pickake level 1: works but dropping it is buggy, drops it somewhere else!
- pickup pickaxes level 2: disappears immediately!


- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)

- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow, falling bag, pick, elevator
  - 2 for guards
  - 3 for wagons
  
- add elevator missing wire tiles

- sprite/tiles color conflict MUCH reduced now. Test it on all screens

- sounds
- music
- maybe try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
