- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow
  - 2 for others
  
- code insert coin (write into number_of_credits_6000)

- compute_logical_address_from_xy_558c to debug as player_grip_handle_test_0784
  yields bogus logical value

- sprite/tiles conflict.

  * maybe make tile palette fit in 16 colors (forgetting BAGMAN title
  and green, purple on screen which can be faked using coppper, which forces to reactivate
  dynamic copper for sprites too unless we restore original colors when displaying title)

  * setting green & purple & title cols after 16 would also work then we just set colors at the line where
  the sprite is displayed (and not in the global copperlist)
