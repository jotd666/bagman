- debug pick_up_object_2176 ("regression" since exx is fixed)

- pickup pickake level 1: works but dropping it is buggy, drops it somewhere else!
  (same issue for bags at some point)
  debug this: take pick and drop it, debug on MAME in //


- press 5 to insert coin works 1 time out of 2

- guard seems hesitant to change direction
- guard at level 3 probably doesn't follow guide & blocks (debug with MAME & addresses at junctions in parallel)
- pickup barrow: turns to pick..., dropping is buggy
- pickup pickaxes level 2: disappears immediately!

- test trainer infinite lives
- highscore screen
- TODO where is D6 defined ? debug this      	| [$0a17: ld   a,l]

- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)

  
- VA logo add dyn copperlist for title only
- brown stripe on row 0?


- sounds
- music

maybe...:
- try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow, falling bag, pick, elevator
  - 2 for guards
  - 3 for wagons


converter: fix exx
