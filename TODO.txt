- "PLAYER 1" flashes with wrong timing
- sometimes carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed with wagons)
  => screen 2: elevator clut forced at white+orange,
     generate 2 copies of elevator and change CLUT in screen 2 so it still matches player clut
	 but uses third color (red)
- check level complete in non whdload (SR not reset so....)
- brown/blue stripe on row 0? disable those rows completely: to retest, seems ok
- sfx are playing in demo when guard is chasing player
- make command line options work: done, to test

- DOS exe: quit then run again => crash. Maybe DONT allow quit from DOS?
- set supervisor state at start in DOS mode (revert to user in the end)
- restore music
- timer at 400: stop sound
- killed: stop sound
- start 2P game??
- joystick/fire to start game/insert coin not working
- TODO where is D6 defined ? debug this      	| [$0a17: ld   a,l]
- invincible flag in demo game should be made inefficient


- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)


maybe...:
- try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow, falling bag, pick, elevator
  - 2 for guards
  - 3 for wagons
