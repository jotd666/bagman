- guards frozen in some places => reset guard
- guard at level 3 probably doesn't follow guide (debug with MAME & addresses)
- pickup barrow: turns to pick..., dropping is buggy
- pickup pickake level 1: works but dropping it is buggy, drops it somewhere else!
- pickup pickaxes level 2: disappears immediately!


- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)

- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow, falling bag, pick, elevator
  - 2 for guards
  - 3 for wagons
  
- add elevator missing wire tiles

- sprite/tiles conflict.

  * maybe make tile palette fit in 16 colors (forgetting BAGMAN title
  and green, purple on screen which can be faked using coppper, which forces to reactivate
  dynamic copper for sprites too unless we restore original colors when displaying title)

  * setting green & purple & title cols after 16 would also work

- sounds
- music
- maybe try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
