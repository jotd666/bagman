- press 5 to insert coin works 1 time out of 2

- guard seems hesitant to change direction
- guard at level 3 probably doesn't follow guide & blocks (debug with MAME & addresses at junctions in parallel)
- drop barrow sprite remains active on the top (screen 1 only)
- pick pickaxe: ok on screen 1, disappears at once on screen 2 or
  even entering level 2
- invincibility for wagon, elevator hit & guard (fall ok)
- player walks out of the ladder too low: stuck in wall
- lives redrawn all the time??? they flicker

- test trainer infinite lives
- highscore screen
- TODO where is D6 defined ? debug this      	| [$0a17: ld   a,l]

- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)

- VA logo add dyn copperlist for title only
- brown stripe on row 0?


- re-record all sounds & samples cleanly
  samples: turn off ay handling, turn off steps
  ay: turn off samples
  
- find where music is played? (on switch screens & sometimes on game start!)

maybe...:
- try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow, falling bag, pick, elevator
  - 2 for guards
  - 3 for wagons
