- default only 1 life should be 2
- "PLAYER 1" flashes with wrong timing
- sometimes carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed with wagons)
  => screen 2: elevator clut forced at white+orange,
     generate 2 copies of elevator and change CLUT in screen 2 so it still matches player clut
	 but uses third color (red)
- check level complete in non whdload (SR not reset so....)
- brown/blue stripe on row 0? disable those rows completely: to retest, seems ok
- sfx are playing in demo when guard is chasing player
- make command line options work: done, to test

- DOS exe: quit then run again => crash
- set supervisor state at start in DOS mode (revert to user in the end)
- restore music, block SFX when music is playing (compute music playing time)
- timer at 400: stop sound
- killed: stop sound
- start 2P game??
- joystick/fire to start game/insert coin not working
- TODO where is D6 defined ? debug this      	| [$0a17: ld   a,l]
- invincible flag in demo game should be made inefficient


- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)


maybe...:
- try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
