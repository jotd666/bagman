- demo mode displays screen 2

- immediate wrong behaviour / crash

- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow
  - 2 for others
  
- code insert coin (write into number_of_credits_6000)


- sprite/tiles conflict.

  * maybe make tile palette fit in 16 colors (forgetting BAGMAN title
  and green, purple on screen which can be faked using coppper, which forces to reactivate
  dynamic copper for sprites too unless we restore original colors when displaying title)

  * setting green & purple & title cols after 16 would also work
