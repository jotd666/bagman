- remaster music
- sometimes carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed with wagons)
  => screen 2: elevator clut forced at white+orange,
     generate 2 copies of elevator and change CLUT in screen 2 so it still matches player clut
	 but uses third color (red)

- start 2P game??
- joystick/fire to start game/insert coin not working



- intermission: music doesn't play / sfx are playing in demo when guard is chasing player
- invincible flag in demo game should be made inefficient: doesn't work: game_locked_6053 during demo???


maybe...:
- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)
- TODO where is D6 defined ? debug this      	| [$0a17: ld   a,l]
- try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
