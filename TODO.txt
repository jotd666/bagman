- press 5 to insert coin works 1 time out of 2 (previous state interfering?)

- timer at 400: stop music (special api)
- killed: stop music
- screen 1/2: player/guard walks out of the ladder too low: stuck in wall
- guard sometimes changes direction with opposite, should not happen (unless stuck)
- guard seems hesitant to change direction
- guard at level 3 maybe? doesn't follow guide & blocks (debug with MAME & addresses at junctions in parallel)
- sometimes carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed with wagons): dump sprite state
- sound: add delay if same sound played more than once: done but not very good
- get rid of walk/climb sounds if music is playing

- guard sometimes stop falling, then resume, sometimes fall twice as fast!
  (probably coupling between both guards)
- test trainer infinite lives
- add infinite time / infinite pick time
- add start score
- add cheat keys: level complete, game over, +10000 points
- highscore screen
- TODO where is D6 defined ? debug this      	| [$0a17: ld   a,l]

- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)

- VA logo add dyn copperlist for title only
- brown stripe on row 0?
- fix CLI command line options
 
maybe...:
- try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow, falling bag, pick, elevator
  - 2 for guards
  - 3 for wagons
