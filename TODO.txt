- end level: locks up when dropping the last bag in barrow
- sometimes carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed with wagons): dump sprite state
- press 5 to insert coin works 1 time out of 2 (previous state interfering?)
- timer at 400: stop music (special api)
- killed: stop music
- guard doesn't see the player when climbing down stairs and player is in a gallery
- guard killed in elevator: falls off the elevator instead of staying there
- guards not taking elevator at level 3 as much as in the original
- guard at level 3 maybe? doesn't follow guide & blocks (maybe it's OK!)
- sound: add delay if same sound played more than once: done but not very good
- get rid of walk/climb sounds if music is playing

- guard sometimes stop falling, then resume, sometimes fall twice as fast!
  (probably coupling between both guards)
- test trainer infinite lives
- add infinite time / infinite pick time
- add start score
- add cheat keys: level complete, game over, +10000 points
- highscore screen
- TODO where is D6 defined ? debug this      	| [$0a17: ld   a,l]


- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)

- VA logo add dyn copperlist for title only
- brown stripe on row 0?
- fix CLI command line options
 
maybe...:
- try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow, falling bag, pick, elevator
  - 2 for guards
  - 3 for wagons
