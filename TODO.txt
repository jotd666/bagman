- OK on whdload, but privilege violation on DOS
- sometimes carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed with wagons): dump sprite state
- press 5 to insert coin works 1 time out of 2 (previous state interfering?)
- timer at 400: stop music (special api)
- killed: stop music
- guard #2 (the one which starts at level 3) doesn't see the player when climbing down stairs and player is in a gallery
- sound: add delay if same sound played more than once: done but not very good
- get rid of walk/climb sounds if music is playing
- restore music
- guard speed doesn't seem to increase with score

- guard sometimes stop falling, then resumes, sometimes fall twice as fast!
  (probably coupling between both guards)
- test trainer infinite lives
- add option to start at hard level directly
- make command line options work
- implement start score
- add cheat keys: F1: level complete (done), F2: +10000 points, F3: game over, 
- highscore screen not working: stuck here
- TODO where is D6 defined ? debug this      	| [$0a17: ld   a,l]

- the original game had a tendency (not all the time) to leave the barrow in the last screen when you completed
  the level, which is unfair and makes next level very difficult because you have to bring back the barrow or go
  to last screen right after appearing in the first screen.
- ??? ground-disappearing bug found when trying to drop a bag off a ledge in screen 3 in the elevator shaft.
- enhance instructions
- save/load highscores


- debug 2640 with values not 10 or E0 (not at start)

- VA logo add dyn copperlist for title only
- brown/blue stripe on row 0? disable those rows completely, make display higher
- fix CLI command line options
 
maybe...:
- try to cookie cut bags & pickaxes, avoid to destroy background
- memory optim: fixed number of bitmap repeats for sprites:
  - 1 for player, barrow, falling bag, pick, elevator
  - 2 for guards
  - 3 for wagons
