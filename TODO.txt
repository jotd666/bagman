- first A500 boot: locks up: investigate (ok when resetting!!)
  vblank works, but doesn't call player walks right...
- intermission: music (second tune) doesn't play

minor:

- sprite allocation issue: sometimes (very rare) player/carried yellow bag becomes blue (sprite alloc with too many sprites displayed with wagons)

probable original game bugs, won't be fixed:

- in demo, guard appears at screen 2, falls and immediately disappears: this is also
  happening in real arcade game demo! So original game bug, fortunately not occurring
  while playing!
- hard bag layout appeared once in 2P mode!
