Amiga controls:

joystick or joypad in port 1 or keyboard

* CD32 joypad (1 or 2 players):

- directions: joystick 1
- buttons: joystick 2
- reverse: insert coin current player
- forward: start 1P or 2P game (depending on the joypad)
- With "winuae joypad" setting, buttons are naturally configured properly
  (no configuration change, joypad has same behaviour as in MAME). Most USB SNES-like
  joypad button colors don't match the actual winuae button.
  Personally I unscrewed my controllers and switched the colors so
  they match, it's very easy to do.
- With "CD32 joypad" setting, the button layout has been made as close as possible
  as original controls so for "attack" joystick:
   * yellow for up
   * red for down
   * green for left
   * blue for right
   
* misc:

- 5 key or joy1 up/down (during non-playing parts) to insert a coin
  or continue 2P game (continue screen)
- 1 key or joy1 fire (during non-playing parts) to start a 1P game
  or give up current 2P game (continue screen)
- 2 key or joy2 fire (during non-playing parts) to start a 2P game
- P key or play button to pause the game
- ESC key to quit & save high-scores (when run from amigaDOS)
